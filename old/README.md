infinite-monkeys
================

You start as a lowly human writer, typing character by character and publishing your garbage writing for tuppence a word. You stumble across an infinitely large room, filled to the brim with an infinite number of monkeys. Understanding that the price of bananas is much lower than the current minimum wage, you decide to hire monkeys to do your typing for you, in the hopes that the odds provide you with words as revolutionary as Shakespeare's.

The monkeys have been living together for so long that their feeding cycles have synced. In order to work, they need bananas. They all get hungry at the same time, so you'll need to be ready with bananas as the work days progress. If you are unable to feed all of the monkeys within a certain time frame, they will get angry and steal bananas. Angry monkeys get hungry faster than happy monkeys. And if you don't have any bananas to steal, they just quit working.

Surely as your infinite monkey operation grows, you will have enough money to purchase cool devices like automatic monkey feeders, and better typewriters, and more nutritious bananas, or maybe you'll delegate other jobs to monkeys, like monkey-feeding monkeys, or banana-buying monkeys, or monkey-novel monkey-publishers. The monkeys are the limit, and luckily the monkeys are limitless.
